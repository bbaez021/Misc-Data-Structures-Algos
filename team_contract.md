# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 

-The team will meet weekly

-Meetings will default to fridays 1:00-1:50pm, though we can change the meeting time with agreement of the group or if more than one member is unable to meet on friday

-Meetings will be on zoom or in person depending on availability of the group

2. **Assistance** 

-Outside of meetings, group communication will take place over discord group chat

-Responses to direct questions or requests on the discord chat should be within a day or two outside of unusual circumstances, even if the response is that addressing the problem will take more time


3. **Respect**

-Respect other people's time and attention

-Don't take credit for other people's work

-Give people space to explain their ideas

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 

-Work should be assigned at group meetings and team members should do their best to complete their work

-If someone begins to fall behind without unusual circumstances, the group should evaluate whether that person isn't putting in enough time or if their workload has been unfairly large or more difficult than expected

-Work distribution should be reasonably even across tasks, though if one group member takes a particular interest in part of the project they may ask to work on more of that component with the consent of the other group members.

5. **Time Commitment** 

-Work commitment and time commitment should both be taken into account

-Commitment to the project should be consistent throughout the project, and group members should contribute steadily throughout

-If someone knows that they will need to commit less time to the project for a short time, they should let the group know at the prior group meeting (or as soon as they know about the disruption if later)


6. **Conflict Resolution** 

-Try to resolve conflicts by group discussion over discord or at group meetings

-If issues do not resolve with discussion from the group, contact course staff about conflict
